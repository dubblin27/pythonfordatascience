#cosine similarity is used to determine / compare 2 documents using bag of words(vectors)
#we can improve the bag of words using the frequency in the documents 
# we can use TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequeny)
# TF - number of occurences of 't' in document 'd'
#IDF = log(D/t)
# D = total number of documents 
# t = number of documents within the term
